#Clean and mutate features.csv
Each row in this file is associated with a track a respondent entered in the mapping tool of the survey (custom programmed in Qualtrics). First, we recode trip frequencies as stated by respondents in form of an interval. We take the mean of the interval for further analysis. Note, respondents stated trip frequencies for the 2018 summer season (current summer) and answered a hypothetical question how the number of trips would have changed would elodea clog some of the waterbodies they boated on.   
```{r}
#calculating pre elodea trip frequencies
features2 <- features%>%
  left_join(freqCoding,  by = c("trackFrequ"="Coding"))   #recoding trip frequencies
features2$freqPre <- round(rowMeans(features2[c("Lower","Upper")], na.rm=TRUE),digits=0)
names(features2)[names(features2)=="Lower"] <- "LowerPre" #Renaming columns for the lower bound of the frequency interval pre invasion
names(features2)[names(features2)=="Upper"] <- "UpperPre" #Renaming columns for the upper bound of the frequency interval pre invasion

#Calculating post elodea trip frequencies
features3 <- features2 %>%
  left_join(freqCoding,  by = c("trackFre_1"="Coding"))
features3$freqPost <- round(rowMeans(features3[c("Lower","Upper")], na.rm=TRUE), digits=0)
names(features3)[names(features3)=="Lower"] <- "LowerPost" #Renaming columns for the lower bound of the frequency interval post invasion
names(features3)[names(features3)=="Upper"] <- "UpperPost" #Renaming columns for the upper bound of the frequency interval post invasion
```

Calculating annual operating cost per route. Here, we calculate the annual km as the product of the stated trip frequency, round-trip length in km (calculated by ArcGIS), the stated hourly boat operating cost, and the inverse of the assumed average travel speed of 10 miles/h (16km/h). Both pre- and post-invasion costs are calculated. 
```{r}
#hCost: hourly operating cost
features3$hCost <- rowMeans(features3[c("hCostHigh","hCostLow")], na.rm=TRUE) #calculating the hCost interval mean for furthe ranalysis, ignore missing 
features3$hCost[features3$hCost==20000] <- NA  #outliers and missing value
#medianCost <- median(features3$hCost, na.rm=TRUE)  #calculating the median cost per h
#features3$hCost <- with(features3, ifelse(is.na(hCost), medianCost, hCost))  # inserting median cost for missing values
features3$hCost[is.nan(features3$hCost)] <- NA  #R tried to get the mean of the Lower and Upper values but if respondent left blank those are NA, so the mean is also NA

#km: outliers, setting frequency of trips pre if Up to 4 setting it to 1 if km >300
features3$freqPre <- with(features3, ifelse(km>300 & trackFrequ=="Up to 4",1,freqPre))

#rank of route
features3$rank <- with(features3, ifelse(rank==0, 1, rank)) #dealing with ranks that are 0

#YrCostPre and Post: calculating the total km per route then annual cost per route
features3$totalKmPre <- with(features3, km * freqPre)
features3$totalKmPost <- with(features3, km * freqPost)
features3$YrCostPre <- with(features3, totalKmPre * hCost)
features3$YrCostPost <- with(features3, totalKmPost * hCost)

#adding up number of trips annually for each respondent across all of his/her routes
totalTripsByRes <- features3%>%
  group_by(responseID)%>%
  summarise(totalTripsPre = sum(freqPre),

##Respondent locations
The  Qualtrics online survey software collects respondent information such as IP addresses which can be used to determine the location the respondent was in when answering the survey. If the respondent completed the survey using the Qualtrics Offline App on a GPS-enabled device, this data will be an accurate representation of the respondent’s location. For all other respondents, the location is an approximation determined by comparing the participant’s IP address to a location database. Inside the United States, this data is typically accurate to the city level.
